# Metaparticle/Package for JavaScript
Metaparticle/Package is a collection of libraries intended to 
make building and deploying containers a seamless and idiomatic
experience for developers.

This is the implementation for JavaScript (NodeJS).

## Introduction
Metaparticle/Package simplifies and centralizes the task of
building and deploying a container image.

Here is a quick example.

Consider this simple Javascript application:

```javascript
console.log('hello world!');
```

To containerize this application, you need to use the `@metaparticle/package` library and
the `containerize` wrapper function like this:

```javascript
const mp = require('@metaparticle/package');

mp.containerize(
	{
		repository: 'brendanburns',
	},
	() => {
        console.log('hello world');
	}
);
```

You can then compile this application just as you have before.
But now, when you run the application, instead of printing "Hello world", it first packages itself as a container, and
then (optionally) deploys itself inside that container.
